# The Drakaea elastica is from Diurideae and should be included.
# Goodyera, Haemaria are both Goodyerinae in subfamily 
# Orchidoideae and could potentially be included as further 
# outgroup. Platanthera is of course already in our target list 
# but I'm not sure if the same species, but we would not need two 
# samples from the same genus. The others species are from other 
# subfamilies and phylogenetically too distant for inclusion.
